# 🚀 Telegram Session Stealer – v2.2 (web.telegram.org/k Clone)

I have developed a **fully functional clone** of [web.telegram.org/k](https://web.telegram.org/k) that replicates the **original interface with 100% accuracy**.  
This tool is built on the **latest version (v2.2, build 626)** and is designed to be **completely undetectable** by browsers — **no red flags, no suspicion, zero alerts**.  

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Victim lands on cloned site** – Looks exactly like the official Telegram Web login page.  
2. **Victim logs in** – All session-related data is extracted from the browser's **local storage**, including:  
   - DC auth keys  
   - Server salts  
   - User ID  
   - Phone number  
   - 2FA password (if used)  
3. **Data is compiled** into a **Base64-encoded session token** and sent to your Telegram bot as a `.txt` file.  
4. **Inject the token** – Decode it and paste into the browser console on [web.telegram.org/k](https://web.telegram.org/k).  
5. **Instant access** – The victim’s account is logged in automatically.
